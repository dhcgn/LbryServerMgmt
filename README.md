# LbryServerMgmt

A graphical user interface to manage multiple server instance of running [lbry-sdk](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk) to contribute in the lbry network with the help to hosting content.

## Motivation

> LBRY is a free, open, and community-run digital marketplace.
> Build the future of content freedom

> What if anyone in the world could publish a piece of digital content, anyone else in the world could access it, for free or for payment, and that entire system worked end-to-end without any centralized authority or point of control?
