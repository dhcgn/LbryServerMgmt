# LbryServerMgmt

A graphical user interface to manage multiple server instances of running [lbry-sdk](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk) to contribute in the lbry network with the help to self hosting content of others or own.

Short: LBRY is a decentralized Youtube

## LBRY

> LBRY is a free, open, and community-run digital marketplace.
> Build the future of content freedom

> What if anyone in the world could publish a piece of digital content, anyone else in the world could access it, for free or for payment, and that entire system worked end-to-end without any centralized authority or point of control?

To support this Idea I want to create an easy solution for people how own a small virtual private server or just some old hardware which can be used to contribute.

### Use Cases

1. Host one video file
1. Host a entire channel with all its videos
1. Automatic refresh to always host the latest content of an channel
1. Get status information of all servers
1. Remove unused content

## Status

Under heavy development! First proof of concept is running fine.
